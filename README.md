# What is PodChain?

Hi! This is a podcasting application that provides incentive to listen due to the underlining cryptocurrency rewards. The application itself stores podcast data in a PostgreSQL DB. 

The users have the option to either listen anonymously, or provide the public key to their wallet so they can unlock the option to mine Podcoin while listening to podcasts.

The users also have the option to contribute to podcast content creators. The content creators will receive 100% of the donations. The donators even get a 30% split of the block reward split based on contributions/transactions on that block. The last 50% of the reward goes 20% to the solver of the block proof and 30% to the miners based on guesses provided.
